# Uploading the Sketch On ESP8266 
If youâ€™re using an ESP8266 NodeMCU Kit, uploading the sketch is very simple, since it has built-in programmer. Plug your board to your computer. 
1. Make sure you have the right board selected:

<br/>
2. You also need to select the Port:

<br/>
3.Then, copy the code provided (<a href="https://github.com/RuiSantosdotme/Random-Nerd-Tutorials/raw/master/Projects/blink_led_esp8266.ino">Blink_led_esp8266.ino</a>:

```c++

int pin = 2;  

void setup() {  
  // initialize GPIO 2 as an output.  <br/>
  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); 
}  

// the loop function runs over and over again forever  <br/>
void loop() { \n
  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
```
